## Introduction

CharmBench aims to facilitate the development and evaluation of multimodal reasoning capabilities in AI. As AI systems become more complex, the ability to reason across different types of dataâ€”such as text, images, and audioâ€”becomes essential. This benchmark offers a structured approach to assess these capabilities.

## Features

- **Multimodal Datasets**: Access diverse datasets that cover various modalities.
- **Benchmarking Tools**: Utilize tools to evaluate model performance effectively.
- **Deep Learning Support**: Compatible with popular deep learning frameworks.
- **Community-Driven**: Engage with a community of researchers and developers.
  
## Installation

To get started with CharmBench, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sandia7171717171/CharmBench.git
   cd CharmBench
   ```

2. **Install Requirements**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Then, install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Release**:
   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/Sandia7171717171/CharmBench/releases) to download the latest version. Follow the instructions in the release notes to execute the files.

## Usage

After installation, you can start using CharmBench. Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you going:

1. **Load the Dataset**:
   ```python
   from charmbench import load_dataset

   dataset = load_dataset('dataset_name')
   ```

2. **Train a Model**:
   ```python
   from charmbench import train_model

   model = train_model(dataset)
   ```

3. **Evaluate the Model**:
   ```python
   from charmbench import evaluate_model

   results = evaluate_model(model)
   print(results)
   ```

## Dataset

CharmBench includes a variety of datasets tailored for multimodal reasoning tasks. Each dataset is structured to facilitate easy access and manipulation. Key datasets include:

- **Text-Image Dataset**: A collection of images paired with descriptive text.
- **Audio-Text Dataset**: Audio clips with corresponding transcripts.
- **Mixed Modality Dataset**: Combines multiple modalities for comprehensive testing.

You can find more information about each dataset in the `datasets` directory.

## Models

CharmBench supports several state-of-the-art models for multimodal reasoning. You can easily integrate these models into your workflow. Key models include:

- **Vision-Language Model**: Designed to understand and generate content based on both visual and textual inputs.
- **Audio-Text Model**: Focuses on understanding relationships between audio and textual data.
- **Unified Multimodal Model**: A comprehensive model that handles all modalities simultaneously.

For detailed documentation on how to use these models, refer to the `models` directory.
