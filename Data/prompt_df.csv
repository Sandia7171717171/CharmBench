499577,"Mu and Eve are close friends. One day, they went to a VR experience center and selected a project called 'Pyramid Mystery Adventure', labeled as 'Hard+'. Before entering, the staff gave them a sinister smile and said: 'The sensations in this simulation can reflect back into real life. While there’s no physical harm, if you don’t want to feel like you’re dying — try to survive!' Suddenly, the scene changed. They found themselves in a desert with dust swirling around, and the majestic Giza pyramids standing in the distance. They eagerly approached the Great Pyramid of Khufu, but just as they got close, the pyramid appeared to vanish. Eve immediately said, 'This phenomenon is caused by ①!' Mu then understood. After searching further, they managed to enter the pyramid. A deep male voice echoed: 'Welcome. The pyramid holds both honor and challenge. As new explorers, how far will you go? Seek the clues, find the key, and earn your passage. Begin!' They found themselves in a sealed room with one locked door. After looking around, they discovered a pedestal with seven grooves (arranged with six surrounding one center groove). Scattered around were seven stone tablets, each engraved with a different symbol. A note in the center of the room read: ""The divine king descends, Greeted by sun and moon.
